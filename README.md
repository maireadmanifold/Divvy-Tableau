# Divvy-Tableau

Tableau visualisation are based on bike hires of street bikes in the city of Chicago, see https://www.divvybikes.com/. The datasource files were taken from https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html resource webpage which is provided free by Divvy Bikes. 

Divvy is a bike share system operated by Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) across Chicago and Evanston. Divvy provides residents and visitors with a convenient, fun and affordable transportation option for getting around and exploring Chicago. Divvy, like other bike share systems, consists of a fleet of specially-designed, sturdy and durable bikes that are locked into a network of docking stations throughout the region. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system. People use bike share to explore Chicago, commute to work or school, run errands, get to appointments or social engagements, and more.
